## Description

Proprietary software, also called nonfree software, means software that doesn't [respect users' freedom and community.](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) A proprietary program puts its developer or owner [in a position of power over its users.](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) This power is in itself an injustice.

The point of this directory is to show by examples that the initial injustice of proprietary software often leads to further injustices: malicious functionalities.

Power corrupts; the proprietary program's developer is tempted to design the program to mistreat its users. (Software designed to function in a way that mistreats the user is called malware.) Of course, the developer usually does not do this out of malice, but rather to profit more at the users' expense. That does not make it any less nasty or more legitimate.

Yielding to that temptation has become ever more frequent; nowadays it is standard practice. Modern proprietary software is typically an opportunity to be tricked, harmed, bullied or swindled.

Online services are not released software, but in regard to all the bad aspects, using a service is equivalent to using a copy of released software. In particular, a service can be designed to mistreat the user, and many services do that. However, we do not list instances of malicious dis-services here, for two reasons. First, a service (whether malicious or not) is not a program that one could install a copy of, and there is no way at all for users to change it. Second, it is so obvious that a service can mistreat users if the owner wishes that we hardly need to prove it.

However, most online services require the user to run a nonfree app. The app is released software, so we do list malicious functionalities of these apps. Mistreatment by the service itself is imposed by use of the app, so sometimes we mention those mistreatments too—but we try to state explicitly what is done by the app and what is done by the dis-service.

When a web site provides access to a service, it very likely sends nonfree JavaScript software to execute in the user's browser. Such JavaScript code is released software, and it's morally equivalent to other nonfree apps. If it does malicious things, we want to mention them here.

When talking about mobile phones, we do list [one other malicious characteristic, location tracking](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-mobiles.html#phone-communications) which is caused by the underlying radio system rather than by the specific software in them.

As of December 2023, the pages in this directory list around 600 instances of malicious functionalities (with more than 710 references to back them up), but there are surely thousands more we don't know about.

Ideally we would list every instance. If you come across an instance which we do not list, please write to webmasters@gnu.org to tell us about it. Please include a reference to a reputable article that describes the malicious behavior clearly; we won't list an item without documentation to point to.

## Addictions

Nonfree (proprietary) software is very often malware (designed to mistreat the user). Nonfree software is controlled by its developers, which puts them in a position of power over the users; [that is the basic injustice](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html). The developers and manufacturers often exercise that power to the detriment of the users they ought to serve.

This typically takes the form of malicious functionalities.

This page deals with malicious functionalities that are added to some programs for the sole purpose of luring users into more and more frequent and intensive use of the program, with the risk of getting addicted.

### How software is made addictive

#### Games

Many games are designed to keep gamers compulsively playing — and spending money on the game. To achieve this result, developers use [techniques that derive from behaviour and brain research](https://www.cracked.com/article_18461_5-creepy-ways-video-games-are-trying-to-get-you-addicted.html):

- *The Skinner Box*
  - An environment in which the user is trained to "push the lever", i.e. Do a certain action over and over again in order to get a reward. This is known as "grinding".
- *Virtual food pellets*
  - Items that have nothing to do with the game itself, but are valuable to gamers because of the work required to obtain them (e.g. EverQuest); some people will end up collecting them for the sake of collecting.
- *Random rewards*
  - They turn the game into the equivalent of a slot machine (e.g. World of Warcraft, ZT Online).
- *Elaborate cycles*
  - Gamers' behaviour can be "shaped" by making cycles (progress from one level to the next) slower and slower, designing complex tasks that are difficult to get out of (e.g. World of Warcraft), or conversely dividing them up in small chunks to avoid frustration (e.g. New Super Mario Bros. Wii).
- *Decay of game assets*
  - This makes it necessary for a gamer to keep playing, without vacations, simply to avoid losing what they have earned so far (e.g. Farmville, Ultima Online, Animal Crossing).

Games such as World of Warcraft, which are considered very addictive, use several of these techniques.

These are even more elaborate ways to get users addicted to a game.

- "Loot boxes" are a direct application of the reanom reward mechanism and their addictiveness is enhanced by seductive animation. They are [akin to gambling](https://www.pcgamer.com/behind-the-addictive-psychology-and-seductive-art-of-loot-boxes/).
- [*Gatcha*](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game) systems, widely used by Japanese games since 2010 may be considered the ancestor of loot boxes. A *gatcha* is the virtual equivalent of a capsule-toy vending machine. Its addictiveness is based on random rewards and also on the basic instinct of people to collect items.
- The developers of gratis ("free-to-play") games apply the techniques described above to [turn their products into slot machines](https://www.psychguides.com/interact/the-psychology-of-freemium/). This is clearly described in an infographic. The revenue generated by these games is directly related to the number of strongly addicted gamers (called "[whales](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/chasing-the-whale-examining-the-ethics-of-free-to-play-games)") and to the amount of money they are willing to spend. Thus developers carefully study the behaviour of millions of users to increase the addictiveness of their games and apply [classical marketing techniques](https://www.uxreviewer.com/home/2019/3/7/5-incredibly-powerful-monetisation-patterns-using-behavioural-economics-in-ux-design) such as the decoy effect to squeeze as much money as possible from gamers.
- [Leader boards](https://keepthescore.com/blog/posts/leaderboards-in-gaming/) can increase addictiveness because some people are so eager to see their name at the top of the board that they will spend an unreasonable amount of time playing.

(Unfortunately, some of the articles referenced above use "free" to mean "zero price". We recommend saying "gratis" instead.)

However, the addictiveness of a game is only one of the determinants of addiction. Equally important are the psychological make-up and life circumstances of the gamer. Gaming addiction, like other addictions is a form of mental escape from an unrewarding life. The sad truth is that, in the long run, it leads to an even worse life.

#### Online Gambling

Online gambling services (and their nonfree client programs) are [designed to be addictive](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/feb/22/gambling-apps-more-dangerous-than-fobts-study-finds), much like on-line games. They achieve this with various different malfunctionalities, oftenn in combination.
